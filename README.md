MOSFET stands for 'Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor'

This project helps you to calculate various aspects of a long channel MOSFET.

This gives an approximate values of potential(Vy), inversion charge(Qi), depletion charge(Qd), electric field along the channel(Ey) and electric field normal to the channel(Ex) along the channel.

This model uses the charge sheet approximation and the gradual channel approximation.
